## Main purpose of component and what problem it tries to solve?

This server component serves as a link between household or business user that consumes or generates electric energy. It is used to provide such data for electricity supplier or distributor in order to help with a very important problem – electric grid balancing. This is a big issue especially during peak hours which usually are in the morning and in the evening. Grid balancing became a significant issue in the last years due to increasing amount of electric vehicles being charged at home and especially if these are charged at peak hours. Renewable energy sources started to play a huge role in grid balancing. Although generating electricity from renewable energy is the main goal of global community, these sources can introduce oversupply. Scientific community became interested in such problem too – a scientific review performed in 2020 proves that supply and demand balancing is indeed a hot topic because number of published publications a year is increasing rapidly since 2015.
